- The mean temperature for June vs. the mean temperature for December is 75 vs. 71, respectively. June is about 4 degrees higher with regard to average temperature. 
- With regard to average overall temperature as well, min temp to max temp. the temperatures for June is overall within a higher range compared to December's average temperature range. 

## Summary

The primary concern for the investor was that the weather was not taken into account during his previous venture and the rain caused the venture to go out of business. With the data from the analysis, the temperature from the months of June and December show an average temperature of 71-75. This would allow the venture go on smoothly taking part in mild weather.
